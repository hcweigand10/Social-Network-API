# Social-Network-API

## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This web app serves as the back end for a potential social networking site. The app is linked to a mongo DB that stores user info, thoughts, and reactions, as well creating associations between users and their thoughts.

I personally wasn't able to set up the reactions, but I hope to remedy that soon. Not a fan of this homework honestly.
